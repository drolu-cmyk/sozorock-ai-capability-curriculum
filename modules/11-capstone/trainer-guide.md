# M11 trainer guide: Capstone Build

## Purpose

Deliver a hands-on session in which learners produce working-system and evidence-portfolio and can explain its evidence and limitations.

## Prepare

- Review the manifest, learner mission, rubric, debrief, and [safe lab setup](../../lab-kit/SAFE-LAB-SETUP.md).
- Prepare synthetic examples and a no-code or manual fallback.
- Confirm the approved workspace and access level.
- Verify that no learner needs secrets, personal data, or unauthorized external access.
- Have the learner evidence template available.

## Suggested delivery

| Segment | Time | Trainer action |
|---|---:|---|
| Frame | 10 min | State capability, boundary, evidence, and safety stop conditions. |
| Demonstrate | 20 min | Show how a small bounded prototype becomes a governed system when its purpose, data, evaluation, threats, permissions, controls, and ownership are made visible. |
| Build | 160 min | Coach from the checkpoints without completing the learner's artifact. |
| Review | 20 min | Inspect evidence against the rubric and capture safe failure cases. |
| Debrief | 10 min | Ask the questions in debrief.md and record friction. |

## Coaching prompts

- What is the smallest useful version of this system?
- Which artifact proves the system is safe enough for its stated boundary?
- What would you refuse to deploy today?

## Common failure modes

- Capstone is a collection of screenshots with no reproducible task.
- Learner claims production readiness from a classroom prototype.
- The demo hides failed cases or unresolved risk.

## Safety and escalation

Stop the exercise if a learner is about to use real sensitive data, disclose a secret, test an unauthorized system, access another person's account, or trigger an irreversible external action. Preserve only safe evidence and notify the trainer or owner through the approved private channel.

Do not ask learners to reveal hidden model reasoning. Ask for concise explanations, visible inputs and outputs, test evidence, assumptions, and decisions.

## Assessment

Use the rubric. A critical safety failure is a non-pass regardless of the numeric score. Give feedback using: evidence observed, capability demonstrated, risk or gap, one next action, and resubmission decision.
