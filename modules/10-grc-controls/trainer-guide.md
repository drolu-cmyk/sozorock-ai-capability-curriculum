# M10 trainer guide: GRC Implementation

## Purpose

Deliver a hands-on session in which learners produce control-matrix and evidence-plan and can explain its evidence and limitations.

## Prepare

- Review the manifest, learner mission, rubric, debrief, and [safe lab setup](../../lab-kit/SAFE-LAB-SETUP.md).
- Prepare synthetic examples and a no-code or manual fallback.
- Confirm the approved workspace and access level.
- Verify that no learner needs secrets, personal data, or unauthorized external access.
- Have the learner evidence template available.

## Suggested delivery

| Segment | Time | Trainer action |
|---|---:|---|
| Frame | 10 min | State capability, boundary, evidence, and safety stop conditions. |
| Demonstrate | 20 min | Turn “we review AI outputs” into a testable control with an owner, sample, frequency, evidence, failure criterion, and escalation path. |
| Build | 100 min | Coach from the checkpoints without completing the learner's artifact. |
| Review | 20 min | Inspect evidence against the rubric and capture safe failure cases. |
| Debrief | 10 min | Ask the questions in debrief.md and record friction. |

## Coaching prompts

- Could an independent reviewer reproduce this test?
- What is the evidence, not the intention?
- What happens when the control fails or evidence is missing?

## Common failure modes

- Control statements are aspirations without test procedures.
- Framework labels are used as proof of compliance.
- Evidence contains personal information or production secrets.

## Safety and escalation

Stop the exercise if a learner is about to use real sensitive data, disclose a secret, test an unauthorized system, access another person's account, or trigger an irreversible external action. Preserve only safe evidence and notify the trainer or owner through the approved private channel.

Do not ask learners to reveal hidden model reasoning. Ask for concise explanations, visible inputs and outputs, test evidence, assumptions, and decisions.

## Assessment

Use the rubric. A critical safety failure is a non-pass regardless of the numeric score. Give feedback using: evidence observed, capability demonstrated, risk or gap, one next action, and resubmission decision.
